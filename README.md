# FlatSquares
During all my developer life i built many game samples & game engine features. I have been made a break on gamedev since i failed to achieve two large games 3 years ago.

At the moment, i really want to come back on gamedev for fun, so i have decided to create a basic 2d game engine for retro game style development. I'm not sure it will be a real project in the futur, but this repository will help me to remind most of knowledge on gamedev

## RoadMap
- XPlatform and mobile first engine
- Factory to allow developer to target different C# game engine (not a huge priority)
- Sceen management
- Audio management
- Node system with common components to build a 2d game
- TMX files import
- Embbed terminal
- ...
